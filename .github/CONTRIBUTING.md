# 🎼 Contributing to Code-Conductor

Thank you for your interest in making Code-Conductor even better! This project thrives on community contributions that help developers worldwide transform their workflows with AI agent coordination.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Contributors

### The Vision
Code-Conductor should enable any developer to go from **tweet discovery → clone → working AI agents** in under 5 minutes. Every contribution should move us closer to this "life-changing" developer experience.

### Ways to Contribute

1. **🌟 Project Examples** - Most impactful! Add configs for new project types
2. **🐛 Bug Fixes** - Improve setup reliability and error handling
3. **📚 Documentation** - Help others discover and use the system
4. **✨ Features** - Enhance the core coordination system
5. **🎥 Content** - Videos, blog posts, tweets showing success stories

## 📋 Contribution Process

### 1. Find Your Contribution Type

#### 🌟 **Project Examples** (High Impact)
*Help developers in new ecosystems*

**Examples needed:**
- Vue/Nuxt applications
- Next.js 13+ with app router
- Django/FastAPI backends
- Go microservices
- Flutter mobile apps
- Astro static sites

**What to include:**
- `config.yaml` with role suggestions
- `example-tasks.json` with realistic tasks
- Comments explaining stack-specific patterns

#### 🐛 **Bug Fixes** (Critical)
*Improve reliability for all users*

**Common issues:**
- Setup failures on different OS/environments
- Edge cases in project detection
- GitHub API authentication problems
- Worktree conflicts

#### ✨ **Feature Enhancements** (Medium Impact)
*Extend core functionality*

**Ideas:**
- Better task dependency management
- Agent role customization
- Performance monitoring
- Integration with other CI/CD tools

### 2. Development Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Code-Conductor.git
cd Code-Conductor

# Test the current setup
python setup.py --debug

# Make your changes
# Test thoroughly with different project types
```

### 3. Testing Your Changes

#### For Example Additions:
```bash
# Test with a real project of that type
cd /path/to/test-project
python /path/to/Code-Conductor/setup.py --auto --debug

# Verify the generated config makes sense
cat .conductor/config.yaml
```

#### For Core Changes:
- Test with Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- Test interactive and auto modes
- Test with various project structures
- Ensure error messages are helpful

### 4. Documentation Standards

- **Code comments**: Explain *why*, not just *what*
- **README updates**: If you change user-facing behavior
- **Example comments**: Help users understand the config choices

## 🎯 Contribution Guidelines

### Project Examples - Quality Standards

**Must have:**
- ✅ Realistic project structure detection
- ✅ Appropriate role suggestions for the stack
- ✅ 4-6 example tasks covering common workflows
- ✅ Stack-specific build validation commands
- ✅ Musical theme in project names (harmony, rhythm, melody, etc.)

**Nice to have:**
- 🌟 Multiple complexity levels (starter, intermediate, advanced)
- 🌟 Integration with popular tools in that ecosystem
- 🌟 Performance optimizations specific to the stack

### Code Quality

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints where helpful
- **YAML**: Consistent indentation, meaningful comments
- **JSON**: Pretty-printed, consistent structure
- **Shell scripts**: Include error handling and helpful output

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commits for clarity:

```
feat(examples): add Vue.js project configuration
fix(setup): handle missing git remote gracefully
docs(readme): update quick start instructions
refactor(core): simplify role detection logic
```

## 🏆 Recognition

Contributors are recognized in several ways:

- **README credits** for significant contributions
- **Example attribution** in config files you create
- **Twitter shoutouts** for major features/examples
