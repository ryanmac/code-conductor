# GitHub Integration

## Issues as Tasks

Create issues with the `conductor:task` label to automatically convert them to tasks.

## Task Format

Tasks are created as GitHub Issues with complete specifications:

**Issue Title**: Implement authentication

**Issue Body**:
```markdown
## Description
Implement user authentication system for the application.

## Specifications
See: docs/auth-spec.md

## Best Practices
- Use JWT tokens
- Implement refresh tokens

## Success Criteria
- Tests: 100% coverage
- Security: Pass security scan
```

**Labels**:
- `conductor:task` (required)
- `effort:medium`
- `priority:medium`
- `skill:backend` (optional, for specialized tasks)

## Automated Workflows

- **Health Monitoring**: Every 15 minutes
- **Stale Cleanup**: Removes abandoned work
- **Task Scheduling**: Processes dependencies
- **Status Reports**: Updates dashboard issue

## GitHub Authentication

Code Conductor uses GitHub's built-in authentication for all operations. No manual token setup is required for most users!

### Default Setup (Recommended)
The workflows generated by Code Conductor automatically use GitHub Actions' built-in `${{ github.token }}`, which provides:
- ✅ Read/write access to issues, pull requests, and code
- ✅ Ability to create and manage labels
- ✅ No setup required - works out of the box!

### Advanced Setup (Optional)
Only create a Personal Access Token if you need:
- Higher API rate limits (5,000/hour instead of 1,000/hour)
- Cross-repository access
- Ability to trigger other workflows

For detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting, see [.conductor/GITHUB_TOKEN_SETUP.md](../.conductor/GITHUB_TOKEN_SETUP.md).
