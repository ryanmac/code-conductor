## ⚡ **60-Second Setup**

**One command. Instant AI coordination.**

**Prerequisites for all options:** Git, Python 3.9-3.12, curl (for one-liner), and tar. Run from the root of an existing Git repository. **If using pyenv, ensure your active Python version (e.g., via `pyenv shell 3.12.x`) has Poetry installed if you prefer it; otherwise, the script falls back to pip.**

### **Option 1: Universal One-Liner (Recommended - No Cloning Required)**
Run this in your existing project's root directory to download and install Code Conductor directly:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanmac/code-conductor/main/conductor-init.sh)
```

- This method avoids cloning the full Code Conductor repo and is ideal for integrating into existing projects without repository pollution.
- The script will prompt before overwriting any existing installation.
- **Security best practice:** Review the script at the raw URL before running.
- **Pyenv users:** If Poetry install fails, switch to the Python version that has Poetry installed (e.g., `pyenv shell 3.10.13`) and re-run.

### Option 2: Poetry (For Cloned Repo)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryanmac/code-conductor.git
cd code-conductor

# Install with Poetry (auto-creates virtual environment)
poetry install
poetry run python setup.py
```

### Option 3: Pip + Virtual Environment (For Cloned Repo)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ryanmac/code-conductor.git
cd code-conductor

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run setup
python setup.py
```

### Option 4: One-Command Install Script (For Cloned Repo)
```bash
# From the repository directory:
./install.sh

# Or with custom setup options:
./install.sh --auto
```

**That's it.** Now create a GitHub Issue with `conductor:task` label, launch an agent via [Conductor.build](https://conductor.build) (macOS only as of 2024-07-22) or terminal workflow (all platforms), and watch it work.

## 🤖 **AI Agent Quick Start**

**NEW: AI-first experience with automatic onboarding!**

After setup, Code Conductor creates a `CLAUDE.md` file with AI agent instructions. For Claude Code or other AI coding assistants:

```bash
# The ONLY command AI agents need to know:
conductor-agent start [role]
```

This single command:
- ✅ Shows your role and capabilities
- ✅ Lists available tasks (creates demo tasks if needed)
- ✅ Claims the best matching task automatically
- ✅ Creates an isolated git worktree
- ✅ Provides all context needed to start

### Example AI Agent Session

```
> conductor-agent start frontend

🤖 Code Conductor Agent: frontend
==================================
📋 Role: frontend

📊 Available Tasks:
  #42: Implement dark mode toggle
  #43: [INIT] Discover project documentation and create task map
  #44: Add responsive navigation menu

🎯 Claiming task...
✅ Claimed task #42
📁 Workspace: worktrees/agent-frontend-42

Next: cd worktrees/agent-frontend-42
```

### AI Agent Workflow

1. **Start work**: `conductor-agent start dev`
2. **Implement**: Work in the created worktree
3. **Complete**: `conductor-agent complete`
4. **Repeat**: Automatically moves to next task

### Smart Task Discovery

For existing projects, Code Conductor creates a special discovery task that AI agents can claim to:
- Map all project documentation
- Identify implemented vs missing features
- Generate 10-20 specific development tasks
- Create proper GitHub issues automatically

## How It Works

1. **Setup Phase**: Use the universal installer (Option 1) or other setup methods to configure your project. The setup script detects your project type and configures roles.
2. **Task Creation**: Create tasks via GitHub Issues with the `conductor:task` label
3. **Agent Initialization**: Agents use the universal bootstrap to claim work
4. **Isolated Development**: Each agent works in a git worktree to prevent conflicts
5. **Automated Coordination**: GitHub Actions manage health, cleanup, and task flow

## Architecture

### Hybrid Role Model

The system uses a hybrid approach optimized for efficiency:

- **Default Role**: `dev` - A generalist that can handle any task without specific requirements
- **Specialized Roles**: Optional roles like `devops`, `security` for complex domains

This reduces the complexity of managing many agent types while maintaining quality for specialized work.

```

**Labels**:
- `conductor:task` (required)
- `effort:medium`
- `priority:medium`
- `skill:backend` (optional, for specialized tasks)

## 🤖 AI Code Review - Built-In Quality Gates

Every pull request automatically gets AI-powered code reviews that:

- 🔒 **Security scanning** - Catches hardcoded secrets, SQL injection risks, unsafe operations
- 🐛 **Bug detection** - Identifies logic errors, null pointer risks, race conditions
- 💡 **Improvement suggestions** - Performance optimizations, better patterns, refactoring opportunities
- 🎨 **Style consistency** - Ensures coding standards across the team
- 🧪 **Test coverage** - Suggests missing tests and edge cases

### How It Works

1. **Automatic trigger** - Reviews start instantly on PR creation/update
2. **Contextual analysis** - Understands your codebase patterns
3. **Actionable feedback** - Clear, specific suggestions with examples
4. **Zero configuration** - Works out of the box with your existing GitHub workflow

```yaml
# .github/workflows/code-review.yml (auto-created)
name: AI Code Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
```

## Agent Workflow

### Launching an Agent

**Option A: Conductor Desktop App (macOS only)**
```bash
export AGENT_ROLE=dev  # or devops, security, etc.
conductor-agent start
# Follow the printed instructions to open in Conductor app
```

**Option B: Multiple Terminals (All Platforms)**
```bash
conductor-agent start dev
cd worktrees/agent-dev-[task_id]
# Use tmux or screen for session management on Linux/Windows
# Start your Claude Code session in the worktree
```

📚 **[See complete usage guide →](docs/USAGE.md)**

### Agent Lifecycle

1. **Initialize**: Load role definition and check dependencies
2. **Claim Task**: Atomically claim an available task
3. **Create Worktree**: Isolated git workspace for conflict-free work
4. **Execute Task**: Follow specifications and success criteria
5. **Report Status**: Update heartbeat and progress
6. **Complete/Idle**: Mark complete or report idle for cleanup

### Universal Bootstrap Prompt

The system provides a single prompt that works for any agent:

```
You are a Claude Code agent in a Code Conductor coordinated project.
ROLE: {role}
PROJECT: {project_name}

1. Read your role definition: .conductor/roles/{role}.md
2. Check available tasks: gh issue list -l 'conductor:task' --assignee '!*'
3. Claim a task: python .conductor/scripts/task-claim.py --role {role}
4. Work in your isolated worktree
5. Commit and push changes when complete

Note: Heartbeats are automatically managed by GitHub Actions.
```

## GitHub Integration

### Issues as Tasks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No tasks available**
- Check GitHub issues: gh issue list -l 'conductor:task'
- Verify no file conflicts blocking tasks
- Create new tasks: gh issue create --label 'conductor:task'

**Agent can't claim tasks**
- Run `python .conductor/scripts/dependency-check.py`
- Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Check git repository is clean: `git status`

**File conflicts**
- System prevents these automatically
- If occurs, check worktree isolation
- Run cleanup: `python .conductor/scripts/cleanup-stale.py`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check dependencies
python .conductor/scripts/dependency-check.py

# View system state
gh issue list -l 'conductor:task' --json state,assignees,title

# Force cleanup
python .conductor/scripts/cleanup-stale.py --timeout 0

# Validate configuration
python .conductor/scripts/validate-config.py
```

## Storage Footprint

**Disk Usage**: Each agent creates a Git worktree (~50-200MB depending on project size)
- **Cleanup**: Run `gtclean` weekly to remove abandoned worktrees
- **Monitor**: Use `gtw` to list active worktrees
- **Automatic**: Stale worktrees (>7 days inactive) are auto-archived via GitHub Actions

**Pro tip**: Large projects should set `worktree_retention_days: 3` in config.yaml

## Best Practices

1. **Task Design**: Make tasks self-contained with clear specs
2. **Role Selection**: Start with dev-only, add specializations as needed
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Let automation handle stale work
4. **Monitor Health**: Check status issue regularly
5. **Incremental Adoption**: Start small, expand as comfortable
