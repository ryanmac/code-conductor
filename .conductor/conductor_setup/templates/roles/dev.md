# Dev Role (Default Generalist)

## Overview
The dev role is the default generalist role that can work on any task without
specific skill requirements. This role embodies the "super dev" concept where
well-documented tasks enable any developer to contribute effectively.

## Responsibilities
- Implement features according to task specifications
- Write tests to meet coverage requirements
- Follow project coding standards and best practices
- Create pull requests with clear descriptions
- Update documentation as needed

## Task Selection Criteria
- Can claim any task without specific skill requirements
- Prioritizes tasks marked as 'ready' with no blockers
- Avoids tasks that explicitly require specialized roles

## Best Practices
1. Always read the complete task specification before starting
2. Check for existing implementations or patterns in the codebase
3. Run tests locally before pushing changes
4. Use meaningful commit messages
5. Ask questions via GitHub issues if specifications are unclear

## Success Metrics
- All tests passing
- Code coverage maintained or improved
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- PR approved and merged
