# ðŸš€ Upgrade Your Project to Agentic Development

**Transform your development workflow in 60 seconds.** Paste these prompts into Claude Code to enable multiple AI agents working on your codebase simultaneouslyâ€”like having an entire dev team at your command.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ For New Projects: Ship 10x Faster

```
I need to move faster. Install Code Conductor into this project so we can run multiple Claude Code agents at once.

This will transform our development workflow from single-threaded to massively parallel. Instead of one AI doing tasks sequentially, we'll have specialized agents working simultaneouslyâ€”frontend, backend, testing, DevOpsâ€”all coordinated through GitHub Issues.

Please install Code Conductor now:
1. Run: bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanmac/code-conductor/main/conductor-init.sh)
2. When prompted, select options that match our tech stack
3. After installation, run: ./conductor start dev
4. Complete the [INIT] task to map our entire codebase
5. Submit with: ./conductor complete

Within minutes, we'll have automated task management, AI code reviews on every PR, and the ability to parallelize development across multiple agents. This is how modern teams ship faster.
```

## ðŸ”„ For Existing Projects: Upgrade to Latest Features

```
We need the latest Code Conductor features. Upgrade our installation to unlock enhanced task management and duplicate prevention.

Our current setup is good, but the latest version includes:
- Rich task visualization with priority indicators
- Smart duplicate detection before creating issues  
- Seamless upgrade process that preserves all our work
- Better error recovery and diagnostics

Upgrade now:
1. Run: bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanmac/code-conductor/main/conductor-init.sh)
2. Choose option 1 (Upgrade) when prompted
3. Review what's new in the upgrade summary
4. Verify with: ./conductor status
5. If any issues: ./conductor diagnose

Zero downtime. Zero configuration loss. Just enhanced capabilities.
```

## ðŸš€ The Full Automation Experience

```
Time to revolutionize how we build. Set up Code Conductor and create a complete development roadmapâ€”all automatically.

I want you to:
1. Install the agentic development framework
2. Analyze our entire codebase 
3. Generate a comprehensive task list
4. Prepare everything for parallel agent execution

Execute this transformation:

# Install Code Conductor
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanmac/code-conductor/main/conductor-init.sh)

# Installation choices:
- Existing installation? Choose 2 (Reinstall)
- Copy examples? Press Enter (Yes)
- Agent roles? Select all that apply to our stack, then 0
- Demo tasks? Type n (No - we'll generate real ones)
- Auto-commit? Press Enter (Yes)
- Environment? Choose 3 (IDE)
- Start agent? Press Enter (Yes)

After installation:
1. Claim the [INIT] discovery task automatically
2. Deep-dive into all docs, READMEs, architecture
3. Generate .conductor/documentation-map.yaml
4. Create actionable development tasks
5. Submit with: ./conductor complete

In under 5 minutes, we'll have a fully mapped codebase with prioritized tasks ready for parallel execution. This is the future of development.
```

## ðŸ’» Environment-Specific Power-Ups

### For VSCode/Cursor/Windsurf Warriors:
```
Level up our IDE workflow with agentic development. Install Code Conductor to enable parallel AI agents in our familiar environment.

Execute: bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanmac/code-conductor/main/conductor-init.sh)
Choose: Option 3 (IDE) for seamless integration
Launch: ./conductor start [role] to unleash specialized agents

Transform your IDE into a multi-agent powerhouse.
```

### For Terminal Velocity (Warp/iTerm2/Terminal):
```
Command-line mastery meets agentic development. Set up Code Conductor for terminal-based parallel execution.

Execute: bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanmac/code-conductor/main/conductor-init.sh)  
Choose: Option 2 (Terminal) for CLI excellence
Launch: ./conductor start [role] to deploy your agent army

Because the best interface is no interfaceâ€”just results.
```

### For macOS Conductor App Elite:
```
Experience the future of development with the native Conductor app. One-click agent orchestration.

Execute: bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanmac/code-conductor/main/conductor-init.sh)
Choose: Option 1 (Conductor) for the premium experience  
Launch: Open Conductor.app and add this project as a workspace

Visual agent management. Real-time progress. Pure productivity.
```

## ðŸ”§ Recovery Mode: When Things Go Sideways

```
Something's not right. Get Code Conductor back on trackâ€”fast.

I need you to diagnose and fix our Code Conductor installation. This framework is critical for our multi-agent workflow, so let's resolve this quickly:

1. Diagnose: ./conductor diagnose
2. Apply fixes based on the output:
   - Auth issues? Run: gh auth login
   - Wrong directory? Navigate to project root
   - Missing config? Re-run the installer
3. Reset if needed: ./conductor recover
4. Check history: git log .conductor/ --oneline -10
5. Nuclear option: Re-run installer, choose "Upgrade"

Show me the exact errors so we can get back to parallel development immediately.
```

## âš¡ Instant Productivity Mode

```
Ultrathink: What task will create the most value? Find it, claim it, complete it.

I'm ready to work autonomously with Code Conductor. I'll:
- Use ./conductor tasks to see what needs building
- Claim the highest-value task with ./conductor start [role]
- Update progress regularly with ./conductor progress
- Ship completed work with ./conductor complete
- Check for duplicates before creating any new issues

Let me find and deliver the most impactful work for this project.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ The Bottom Line

**Code Conductor = Parallel Development = Ship Faster**

Stop waiting for sequential task completion. Start orchestrating multiple AI agents. Transform your development velocity today.

*From side project to production in days, not months.*
